    <h1>The Early Years.</h1>
    <br>
    <h3>Every kid starts out as a natural-born scientist, and then we beat it out of them. A few trickle through the system with their wonder and enthusiasm for science intact. </h3>
        <br>
        <p>I hated school, thats not an understatement, I hated school. Now that I think about it, it might not have been school as much as it was anybody who thought they were in any sort of authortive position. I even hate stop signs! Its been said that power corrupts, and absolute powers corrupts absolutely. I firmly believe that. It appears that I am rambling on, and I must appoligize as I have a tendency to do that sometimes. Some of my earliest memories are of sitting at school and being yelled at for reading ahead in a book, or not wanting to go play outside for recess and prefering to stay in and read. All I wanted to do was absorb any and all information about any subject I could get my hands on. This didnt sit well with my teachers as they tend to stay on one thing for too long. "I dont care that the color of the curtins ment that the author was depressed, all that mattered to me was that they were blue.". It got better in middle school, as there I found people and teachers that didnt care what I was doing, or what I was reading as long as I kept up in class. </p>

        <h2>Middle school.</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known.</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Middle school, for a lot of people they have memories of the sports they played and the frields they made, but not me. I remember first falling in love with computers. I had been barely exposed to computers in elementry school and the fact there there was a device I could use to type up what I wanted to say and not have to write it out was wonderful! (My writing is terrible as my spelling, computers fixed both). I didnt get to use the computers as much as I wanted as they were only available in the computer lab, but every chance I got I was there! I even voluntered to work in the library to assist teachers during my study hall just to have more computer time! Oh the time I had! IRC, Origen trail, MUDs, you name it I was on it and learning everything I could about it! This lasted up until High school until I got my own computer.</p>

        <h2>High School.</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>We live in a society exquisitely dependent on science and technology, in which hardly anyone knows anything about science and technology.</h3>
        <br>
        <p>High School was actually lots of fun! I now had at my house this thing called the world wide web! The world wide web or the internet as its more commonly called changed how I have read and learned for the rest of my life. No longer was I stuck staying after school to look up wantever I wanted, no longer was I limited on what I wanted to search! I was free! I began learning how to make the computer do what I wanted it to, this including learning basic scripting, and some basic programming. This continued throughout college and continues to be a hobby to this day! I strongly believe that the things that I have learned about computers including, basic programming, basic matiance, and computer assembly should be tought to everyone at an early age and programming should be a part of the core learning in public schools.</p>
